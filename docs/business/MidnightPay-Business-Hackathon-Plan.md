⏺ MidnightPay MVP: What You Can Realistically Build for the Hackathon

  Given your existing midnight-bank codebase and hackathon time constraints, here's a strategic MVP that maximizes impact while being achievable:

  Core MVP: "Privacy-First Subscription Payments"

  Focus on ONE killer feature that demonstrates the full value proposition.

  What to Build (Technically Feasible)

  Smart Contract Extensions (2-3 days)

  1. Merchant Registration Circuit
    - Extend your existing account creation to support merchant accounts
    - Add merchant verification flags (unverified → verified based on transaction count)
  2. Subscription Authorization Circuit
    - Build on your existing transfer authorization system
    - Add recurring payment logic with amount caps and frequency limits
    - Auto-pause when insufficient funds (instead of failing)
  3. Subscription Payment Processing
    - Merchant-triggered recurring charges (extends your send_to_authorized_user)
    - Cryptographic proof of service delivery before charging
    - Payment history without exposing individual amounts

  API Layer Extensions (1-2 days)

  - Add merchant-specific endpoints to your existing bank-api.ts
  - Subscription management functions
  - Payment request generation
  - Simple webhook system for merchants

  UI Demonstration (2-3 days)

  Two separate interfaces:

  1. Customer App (extend your existing bank-ui)
    - Subscribe to services with spending limits
    - View encrypted subscription status ("Active", "Paused")
    - Approve/deny subscription payments
  2. Merchant Dashboard (new simple interface)
    - Register as merchant
    - Create subscription services
    - Trigger subscription charges
    - View aggregated (encrypted) revenue metrics

  MVP Demo Flow (2-minute pitch)

  1. Merchant Setup (30 seconds)
    - "Sarah runs a newsletter and wants to accept subscriptions privately"
    - Creates merchant account, sets up $5/month newsletter subscription
  2. Customer Privacy (60 seconds)
    - "John subscribes but doesn't want his newsletter habits tracked"
    - Sets cryptographic limit: "Never charge more than $10/month"
    - Subscription processes monthly without exposing what he's subscribed to
  3. The Magic Moment (30 seconds)
    - John's balance gets low → subscription auto-pauses (no failed payment)
    - Sarah can prove she has "50+ subscribers" for investor meetings without revealing exact count
    - John can prove he's a "premium subscriber" for exclusive content without revealing which services

  Key Technical Demonstrations

  Privacy Proofs You Can Actually Build

  1. Merchant Verification: Prove "processed >10 transactions" without revealing exact count
  2. Subscription Privacy: Show active subscriptions without revealing merchant names
  3. Revenue Thresholds: Merchant proves "earning >$100/month" without exact amount
  4. Customer Value: Prove "total subscriptions <$50/month" for credit applications

  What Makes This MVP Hackathon-Winning

  Immediate Market Need

  - Creators on OnlyFans/Patreon want payment privacy
  - Customers hate subscription surprises and difficult cancellations
  - Current solutions (Stripe, etc.) offer zero privacy

  Technical Innovation

  - First implementation of cryptographic subscription limits
  - Auto-pause instead of decline (revolutionary UX)
  - ZK proofs for business metrics without surveillance

  Clear Business Value

  - Solves real pain points for both sides
  - Shows path to revenue (transaction fees)
  - Demonstrates regulatory compliance possibilities

  MVP Development Timeline (7-10 days)

  Days 1-3: Smart Contracts
  - Merchant account structure
  - Subscription circuits
  - Basic recurring payment logic

  Days 4-5: API Integration
  - Extend existing bank API
  - Add merchant-specific functions
  - Simple webhook system

  Days 6-8: UI Demo
  - Customer subscription interface
  - Basic merchant dashboard
  - Payment flow demonstration

  Days 9-10: Polish & Demo Prep
  - Bug fixes and testing
  - Demo script and presentation
  - Video/screenshots for submission

  What You DON'T Need to Build

  ❌ Skip for MVP:
  - Complex loyalty programs
  - Multi-party invoicing
  - Advanced analytics
  - Mobile apps
  - Production-grade security
  - Regulatory compliance features

  ✅ Focus on Core Value:
  - Subscription privacy
  - Cryptographic spending limits
  - Merchant verification proofs
  - Clean demo flow

  Hackathon Pitch Strategy

  Opening Hook: "What if I told you that your credit card company knows more about your reading habits than your family does?"

  Problem: Current subscription services are surveillance systems that track every purchase, enable arbitrary charges, and make cancellation difficult.

  Solution: MidnightPay's cryptographic subscription system gives customers spending limits that merchants cannot exceed while protecting everyone's privacy.

  Demo: Live 3-minute demo showing the entire subscription flow with privacy proofs.

  Market: $120B subscription economy with 40% of consumers avoiding purchases due to privacy concerns.

  This MVP is achievable, demonstrates real innovation, and positions you perfectly for the "Protect That Data" ($3,500) prize category while building toward a legitimate business
  opportunity.
